TERMS OF USE

If something isn't covered in these terms and conditions and you are considering doing it then please get permission from me before doing whatever it may be. If I have failed to mention a specific scenario I am not endorsing that case without explicit permission. Keeping creative works open enough that others may enjoy them but secure enough that a creator is credited in a way they appreciate is tricky. I am going to try to keep things simple in an open, honest, and trusting manner with the hope that you will do the same in regard to me.
