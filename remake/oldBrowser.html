	###DEVELOPED BY RYAN COMBES###
	###PLEASE SEE LICENSE AND README###
	This game is being developed as a remake of a Ludum Dare 29 entry that can be viewed at <http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=34866>. The game was not completed within the timeframe specified by Ludum Dare (72 hrs) but the theme ("Beneath the Surface") was compelling. Ryan/shasharala took the theme as a reflection of the metaphysical constructs that the player tends to automatically assume when playing a game.

	This game will challenge those assumptions by making the player look deeper into various mechanics that are driving gameplay in order to succeeed.
