you are dead
you are, but you don't know it
you will utilize masks and wit and fight your way through to find out this secret
you will find mcguffins to learn more about yourself in your environment
you will utilize a dark power to interact with your environment metaphysically
you will reach your final destination, your final moment, when you realize you are actually dead and carrying out the ordered chaos of the universe that you are now a part of... only when you accomplish so much, realize all, but fail

- dialogue choices with masks/faces/expressions to make dialogue even more unique

-metaphysical interaction with your environment. you can make light where there is none visible, simply by exploring the darkness around you at a molecular level, finding that small inkling of light, and surfacing it into a bright, visible glow ( puzzle game? w/revolving pieces? infected cells game puzzle? like go/othello? battle against atoms?)

-abilities to tie into masks/metaphysical interaction?

- no 'correct' choice? only differing hardships depending on the masks worn/decisions made?

-mcguffins? pieces of yourself/memories/abilities/powers? certain powers must be necessary to finish game, ala metroidvania/zelda games?

- by finishing the game, you're simply doing what you were meant to do all along. service the reality that surrounds you. bring light to the people you interact with, even with your gloomiest face. drive them to actions they wouldn't have made otherwise. You are reality and reality is constantly looking back in on itself, for good or for bad, actions are made to progress something, anything, further along. The agent that carries those actions is time and time is the agent we all create but hate. it is dependent on us for its survival but we feed it earnestly, relying upon the standards it creates between us, the common ground, the reality that unfurls from it with each passing moment.

- timed dialogue?

- emotions tied to masks? in reaction to earlier events?

- to progress further you must die more, unlocking new abilities each time, but to finish the game you need to absolve yourself/bury those bodies?
