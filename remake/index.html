	###DEVELOPED BY RYAN COMBES###
	###PLEASE SEE LICENSE AND README###
	This game is being developed as a remake of a Ludum Dare 29 entry that can be viewed at <http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=34866>. The game was not completed within the timeframe specified by Ludum Dare (72 hrs) but the theme ("Beneath the Surface") was compelling. Ryan/shasharala took the theme as a reflection of the metaphysical constructs that the player tends to automatically assume when playing a game.

	This game will challenge those assumptions by making the player look deeper into various mechanics that are driving gameplay in order to succeeed.

		<p id="test">
			You are drifting, falling, flying effortlessly into a white expanse of light that now surrounds you. As the brightness diffuses, burning itself into your retina, you quickly close your eyes in an attempt to shut it out. Startlingly, the brightness that you saw with your eyelids open is still present with them closed and getting brighter every moment. Opening your eyes and twisting about in an effort to get some form of bearing does not change what you are seeing. The light buries itself into your mind, seizing it in a fantastic moment of pain...
			<br \>
			<br \>
			You awake with a start, opening your eyes to darkness, immediatly aware that whatever you are lying on is not your bed. The blackness surrounding you is formidable. <span class="aLink" onclick="replaceF(this, 'test2')">Peering</span> deeply into the black stillness around you is a frightening prospect, but not nearly as terrifying as the idea of <a>navigating</a> your way around it without some form of lumination to help guide you.
		</p>
		<p id="test2" style="display: none; opacity: 0;">
			Slowly crawling off of the 'bed' you awoke on reveals a surprisingly warm but solid flooring. Its surface feels marred, cracked, weathered. Not only is it slightly warm but it feels as though it may be emanating heat. You consider <span class="aLink" onclick="replaceF(this, 'test')">crawling back</span> to where you came from, the idea of wherever it is that you are having a tepid floor <i>is</i> a bit unnerving.

			Despite having no idea where you are or what lies before you the idea of <span class="aLink" onclick="fadeOut(this)">moving forward</span> and exploring more of your environment whispers quietly in the back of your mind.
